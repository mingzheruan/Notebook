Recursion

1.  表象上: function calls itself
2.  实质上: Boil down a big problem to smaller ones (size n depends on size n-1, or n-2 or...n/2)
3.  Implementation 上:
    1.  Base case: smallest problem to solve
    2.  Recursive rule: how to make the problem smaller (if we can resolve the same problem but with a smaller size, then what is left to do for the current problem size n)
