# Dynamic Programing

### General approach to solving optimisation problems using Dynamic Programing

1. Characterize the structure of an opt solution
2. Recursively define **the value** of an opt solution
3. compute the value of an opt solution in a bottom up fashion
4. construct an opt sol from computed information
