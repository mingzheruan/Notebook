## Practice Speaking

### Content

1. explain high-level idea by one sentence
2. explain every important data structure and physical significance of variable
3. explain the algorithm in mid-level, for example, initialization, how to do in each step, terminal condition, and base case + recursive rule
4. time complexity and space complexity

eg: 

So the maxProdut function, take the input length of rope

and return max product of cutting.

<br>

we always assume the length is greater than one,

<br>

and before, we are doing these,  dynamic programming, we have to allocate int array, of size of them plus one 

<br>

for the base case, we are saving index zero and one to zero

......................(one sentence)

for the induction rule

we are using two loops
